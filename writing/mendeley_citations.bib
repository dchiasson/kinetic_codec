abstract = {The ultimate judges of the quality of reproduced pictures are human observers In many practical situations it is desirable to have objective measures which closely mirror the performance of the human viewer; today we lack accurate measures. To study this problem, a set of five pictures was used in which distortions of different types were introduced. The resulting series of pictures was rated by viewers by means of an impairment rating test. These ratings were then compared with various objective measures of the error. The objective measure is sought which is most closely monotonically related in a smooth manner to the subjective measure. The average spread of the subjective deviations about a polynomial regression of the subjective measure onto the objective measure is used as the criterion. This technique is used to study both linearly filtered error measures and picture dependent nonlinear weightings of the error. The procedure has enabled a crude quantative model of the human viewer to be determined. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1979 by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.},

abstract = {Technology has become ubiquitous, it is all around us and is becoming part of us. Together with the rise of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm and enabling technologies (e.g., Augmented Reality (AR), Cyber-Physical Systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain or edge computing), smart wearables and IoT-based garments can potentially have a lot of influence by harmonizing functionality and the delight created by fashion. Thus, smart clothes look for a balance among fashion, engineering, interaction, user experience, cybersecurity, design and science to reinvent technologies that can anticipate needs and desires. Nowadays, the rapid convergence of textile and electronics is enabling the seamless and massive integration of sensors into textiles and the development of conductive yarn. The potential of smart fabrics, which can communicate with smartphones to process biometric information such as heart rate, temperature, breathing, stress, movement, acceleration, or even hormone levels, promises a new era for retail. This article reviews the main requirements for developing smart IoT-enabled garments and shows smart clothing potential impact on business models in the medium-term. Specifically, a global IoT architecture is proposed, the main types and components of smart IoT wearables and garments are presented, their main requirements are analyzed and some of the most recent smart clothing applications are studied. In this way, this article reviews the past and present of smart garments in order to provide guidelines for the future developers of a network where garments will be connected like other IoT objects: the Internet-of-Smart-Clothing.},

A keyword search of titles, abstracts and keywords which included studies using accelerometers, gyroscopes and/or magnetometers to analyse sport motor-tasks performed by athletes (excluding risk of injury, physical activity, and energy expenditure) resulted in 2040 papers. Papers and reference list screening led to the selection of 286 studies and 23 reviews. Information on sport, motor-tasks, participants, device characteristics, sensor position and fixing, experimental setting and performance indicators was extracted. The selected papers dealt with motor capacity assessment (51 papers), technique analysis (163), activity classification (19), and physical demands assessment (61). Focus was placed mainly on elite and sub-elite athletes (59%) performing their sport in-field during training (62%) and competition (7%). Measuring movement outdoors created opportunities in winter sports (8%), water sports (16%), team sports (25%), and other outdoor activities (27%).

This measurement method has a high impact in human performance assessment and human-robot interaction. IMU motion tracking systems are indeed self-contained and wearable, allowing for long-lasting tracking of the user motion in situated environments. After a survey on IMU-based human tracking, five techniques for motion reconstruction were selected and compared to reconstruct a human arm motion. IMU based estimation was matched against motion tracking based on the Vicon marker-based motion tracking system considered as ground truth. Results show that all but one of the selected models perform similarly (about 35 mm average position estimation error). {\textcopyright}2017 by the authors.},

abstract = {The proliferation of miniaturized electronics has fueled a shift toward wearable sensors and feedback devices for the mass population. Quantified self and other similar movements involving wearable systems have gained recent interest. However, it is unclear what the clinical impact of these enabling technologies is on human gait. The purpose of this review is to assess clinical applications of wearable sensing and feedback for human gait and to identify areas of future research. Four electronic databases were searched to find articles employing wearable sensing or feedback for movements of the foot, ankle, shank, thigh, hip, pelvis, and trunk during gait. We retrieved 76 articles that met the inclusion criteria and identified four common clinical applications: (1) identifying movement disorders, (2) assessing surgical outcomes, (3) improving walking stability, and (4) reducing joint loading. Characteristics of knee and trunk motion were the most frequent gait parameters for both wearable sensing and wearable feedback. Most articles performed testing on healthy subjects, and the most prevalent patient populations were osteoarthritis, vestibular loss, Parkinson's disease, and post-stroke hemiplegia. The most widely used wearable sensors were inertial measurement units (accelerometer and gyroscope packaged together) and goniometers. Haptic (touch) and auditory were the most common feedback sensations. This review highlights the current state of the literature and demonstrates substantial potential clinical benefits of wearable sensing and feedback. Future research should focus on wearable sensing and feedback in patient populations, in natural human environments outside the laboratory such as at home or work, and on continuous, long-term monitoring and intervention. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Thanks to the rapid proliferation of connected devices, sensor-generated time series constitute a large and growing portion of the world's data. Often, this data is collected from distributed, resource-constrained devices and centralized at one or more servers. A key challenge in this setup is reducing the size of the transmitted data without sacrificing its quality. Lower quality reduces the data's utility, but smaller size enables both reduced network and storage costs at the servers and reduced power consumption in sensing devices. A natural solution is to compress the data at the sensing devices. Unfortunately, existing compression algorithms either violate the memory and latency constraints common for these devices or, as we show experimentally, perform poorly on sensor-generated time series. We introduce a time series compression algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios while requiring less than 1KB of memory and adding virtually no latency. This method is suitable not only for low-power devices collecting data, but also for servers storing and querying data; in the latter context, it can decompress at over 3GB/s in a single thread, even faster than many algorithms with much lower compression ratios. A key component of our method is a high-speed forecasting algorithm that can be trained online and significantly outperforms alternatives such as delta coding. Extensive experiments on datasets from many domains show that these results hold not only for sensor data but also across a wide array of other time series.},

Data were collected from a body sensor network consisting of six wearable inertial sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) located on the right and left thighs, shins, and feet. Additionally, two electromyography sensors were used on the quadriceps (front thigh) to measure muscle activity. This database can be used not only for activity recognition but also for studying how activities are performed and how the parts of the legs move relative to each other. Therefore, the data can be used (a) to perform health-care-related studies, such as in walking rehabilitation or Parkinson's disease recognition, (b) in virtual reality and gaming for simulating humanoid motion, or (c) for humanoid robotics to model humanoid walking.

Общие уравнения системы и метод их анализа Теоретическое исследование задач динамики систем в целом ряде слу­ чаев приводится к интегрированию обыкновенных стохастических диффе­ ренциальных уравнений, включающих безынерционные многомерные не­ линейные элементы мультипликативного и более сложных типов. К таким задачам относятся, например, исследование точности многоканальных авто­ матических систем при учете перекрестной связи каналов, исследование динамики некоторых нелинейных экстремальных самонастраивающихся систем, находящихся под действием случайных возмущений, исследование случайных колебаний упругих систем при учете нелинейных факторов (восстанавливающей силы, демпфирования и инерционности), а также целый ряд других задач. В достаточно общей форме уравнения, характери­ зующие поведение этих систем, могут быть представлены в виде Xi = фг(#1, . . . , Хп) + Zi (* = 1, . . . , ft), (1) где фг — однозначные нелинейные функции своих аргументов, Zi(t) — воз­ мущения, являющиеся случайными функциями времени. Для определения основных вероятностных моментов переменных, ха­ рактеризующих поведение упомянутых систем, возможно применение ме­ тода статистической линеаризации [1, 2], распространенного на много­ мерные безынерционные нелинейности *. При применении этого метода нелинейные функции ф г -заменяются статистическими линеаризованными эквивалентами фг(#1, . . . , Х п) Ж фго(^х,, • • • т х п , k XlXl , . . . ,},

@article{Kiely2004,
abstract = {We examine the use of Golomb-power-of-2 (GPO2) codes to efficiently and loss- lessly encode sequences of nonnegative integers from a discrete source. Specifically, we're interested in the problem of selecting which GPO2 code to use for a source or a block of samples; this problem is at the heart of the well-known Rice entropy cod- ing algorithm. We're particularly concerned with the case where the mean sample value is known or can be estimated. We derive bounds on the optimum code parameter as a function of the mean sample value. These bounds establish that no more than three possible code choices can be optimum for a given mean sample value. We derive a simple method to select the optimum GPO2 code for a geometrically distributed source given the mean value. We also devise a simpler code selection procedure that generalizes previously known methods. Both code selection methods can be implemented using only integer arithmetic and table look-ups, and require no divisions. We show that, for any source with known mean, the GPO2 code parameter selected under this simple procedure is always within one of the optimum code parameter for the source, and that the added cost due to suboptimum parameter selection under this procedure is never more than 1/2 bit per sample and no more than about 13 percent inefficiency. We investigate the use of both code selection procedures as lower complexity alternatives to Rice coding within the emerging Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) image compression standard. For the images tested, both code selection methods produce negligible added rate compared to optimal code selection as in Rice coding.},

This technology is now abundant, with gadgets named after a standard (mp3 players) and the ability to play high-quality audio from literally billions of devices. The usual paradigm for these systems is based on filterbanks, followed by quantization and coding, controlled by a model of human hearing.

@book{Nelson1996,
abstract = {Four spreadsheet templates are presented to carry out routine statistical analyses with relatively small amounts of data: two-sample Student's t test, one-factor analysis of variance with replication, two-factor analysis of variance with replication, and Wilcoxon's non-parametric two-sample T-test (Mann and Whitney U-test). The use of sometimes complex IF and logic (AND, OR) functions in these templates is a means of maintaining a neat output presentation by avoiding error values, selection of appropriate forms of the t-test, and iteratively assigning mean ranks to data in the non-parametric test. The advantages of the spreadsheet approach accrue through using a multi-purpose package rather than dedicated statistics programs, having usually unobstructed access to the program for modification, relative ease of programming spreadsheets, and ease of correction and alteration of input data. Disadvantages are the limited size of templates and the small number of templates available. Spreadsheets represent a declarative form of programming rather than procedural, with consequent advantages in specifying the problem to be solved, which may have particular application in teaching statistics and programming at undergraduate level. {\textcopyright} 1986 IRL Press Limited.},

Analyzing the role of wearable technology for different users and why there is such a need for these devices in everyday lives. It shows how different sensors are influential in delivering a variety of readings that are useful in many ways regarding sport attributes. Wearables are increasing in function, and through integrating technology, users are gathering more data about themselves. The amount of wearable technology available is broad, each having its own role to play in different industries. Inertial measuring unit (IMU) and Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors are predominantly present in sport wearables but can be programmed for different needs. In this review, the differences are displayed to show which sensors are compatible and which ones can evolve sensor technology for sport applications.},

abstract = {Floating-point arithmetic is considered as esoteric subject by many people. This is rather surprising, because floating-point is ubiquitous in computer systems: Almost every language has a floating-point datatype; computers from PCs to supercomputers have floating-point accelerators; most compilers will be called upon to compile floating-point algorithms from time to time; and virtually every operating system must respond to floating-point exceptions such as overflow. This paper presents a tutorial on the aspects of floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems. It begins with background on floating-point representation and rounding error, continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating point standard, and concludes with examples of how computer system builders can better support floating point. {\textcopyright} 1991, ACM.

abstract = {Sun exposure has been clearly implicated in premature skin aging and neoplastic development. These features are exacerbated in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a hereditary disease, the biochemical hallmark of which is a severe deficiency in the nucleotide excision repair of UV-induced DNA lesions. To develop an organotypic model of DNA repair deficiency, we have cultured several strains of primary XP keratinocytes and XP fibroblasts from skin biopsies of XP patients. XP skin comprising both a full-thickness epidermis and a dermal equivalent was successfully reconstructed in vitro. Satisfactory features of stratification were obtained, but the expression of epidermal differentiation products, such as keratin K10 and loricrin, was delayed and reduced. In addition, the proliferation of XP keratinocytes was more rapid than that of normal keratinocytes. Moreover, increased deposition of cell attachment proteins, alpha-6 and beta-1 integrins, was observed in the basement membrane zone, and beta-1 integrin subunit, the expression of which is normally confined to basal keratinocytes, extended into several suprabasal cell layers. Most strikingly, the in vitro reconstructed XP skin displayed numerous proliferative epidermal invasions within dermal equivalents. Epidermal invasion and higher proliferation rate are reminiscent of early steps of neoplasia. Compared with normal skin, the DNA repair deficiency of in vitro reconstructed XP skin was documented by long-lasting persistence of UVB-induced DNA damage in all epidermal layers, including the basal layer from which carcinoma develops. The availability of in vitro reconstructed XP skin provides opportunities for research in the fields of photoaging, photocarcinogenesis, and tissue therapy},
